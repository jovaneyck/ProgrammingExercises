An implementation for the Monty Hall problem.
=============================================

A full description can be found [here](https://github.com/yatz3000/Monty-Hall-Kata).

The stuff I tried out in this kata:
* London style TDD, as discussed in the book [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests] (http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/).
* Some initial experiences with .net [WPF] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us//library/ms754130.aspx)
* [TestStack.White](https://github.com/TestStack/White), an automated test framework for desktop UI applications.
