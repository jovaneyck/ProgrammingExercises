Your boss asks you to add the following features to your patented rent-a-movie application:

* Add a new way of printing statements: instead of text output, support HTML output.
* Add support for a new type of movies: Adult Movies. Adult Movies cost 4$ per rented day. If you rent an Adult Movie for more than two days, you get 2 extra frequent renter points.
