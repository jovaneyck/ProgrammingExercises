# TDD with Mock Objects: Design Principles and Emerging Properties

This is a fork of Luca Minudel's original repo. He was using it for a study of TDD and Design principles. I am using it as a repository for storing four exercises useful for people wishing to improve their skills with TDD and SOLID principles. Please look at my blog post ["SOLID principles and TDD"](http://emilybache.blogspot.com/2012/09/solid-principles-and-tdd.html) for background reading, or my book ["The Coding Dojo Handbook"](http://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

- If you just want to do the exercises, copy the starting code of the [TDD micro-exercises] (https://github.com/emilybache/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises) in C#, Java, Javascript or Python. It's the same exercises, just translated into the various languages.

- When you've had a go yourself, you could look at  [proposed solutions] (https://github.com/emilybache/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises.ProposedSolution) in C#, Java, Javascript. If you've done the exercises in Python, you might be interested in my blog post ["SOLID exercises in Python"](http://emilybache.blogspot.fi/2012/09/solid-exercises-in-python.html).

- For background reading about Luca's study, see the [paper] (https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Paper/mockobjects_emergingproperties.pdf?raw=true) and the [presentation] (https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Slides/TDD-SOLID.pdf?raw=true) from Luca's own repo.
